High Performance P2P+F2F Network Engine, Mainly for Persistent MMO Game Worlds

Why?
----

With popular P2P networks such as Tor, BitTorrent and Bitcoin featured in the news almost every day, 
and F2F networks such as CJDNS and RetroShare becoming very popular despite their unstable bleeding edge
nature, it has become increasingly obvious that not everyone is enamored with the Cloud this and Cloud that.

As an alternative to Cloud Gaming, one that respects the privacy and security of gamers and game developers, 
and reflects Open Culture methods and principles, it has becoming increasingly evident that P2P networks
must be developed to accomidate huge persistent virtual worlds, such as Massively Multiplayer Online Games 
and 3D virtual worlds similar to Second Life, Avination or OpenSim to facilitate a free and open Internet.

With NSA and HLS abuses becoming daily news, illegal wiretapping, extrajudicial secret kangaroo courts and 
black prisons and internment camps, Guatanamo Bay being synonymous with concentration camps, and all manner 
abuses and crimes against humanity both culpable and liable by the State, it is becoming increasingly 
obvious that even everyday average citizens must participate daily in markets that are unregulatable, 
uncensorable, undetectable, uninterceptable and uncontrollable by design.

The architecture of such a network usually consists of a mixture of Tor, I2P, Babel or Batman underground 
adhoc wifi, or even illicitly-buried twisted pair or coaxial cables, sometimes wired through secret tunnels.

All of this would never need to exist in a free society. Thus, we do not live in a free society. We live, 
yet again, under the steel-toed jackboots of tyrrany.

The tree of liberty thirsts for the blood of tyrants. It's well beyond time to water her.

How?
----

The short answer is "don't be a target." If there is no high-value strategic target to commandeer and use 
as a honey-pot (a type of trap related to an ambush), or high-value individual targets that can be located 
and neutralized.

The long answer is to evade identification, location and capture by using a mixture of time-tested and 
proven techniques often used by drug cartels, moonshiners, child pornographers, terrorists, insurrectionists, 
organized crime and identity thieves, as well as some newer technologies and methodologies, as 
countereconomics and counterculture is constantly evolving.

As far as the Fox Engine is concerned, multiple layers of indirection and redirection helps to frustrate 
attempts to identity and locate valuable targets for interception and capture, by using a more 
recent form of onion routing, high-performance location-aware and mobile-friendly routing and switching, 
and advanced caching and content distribution schemes similar to Freenet or GNUnet only fast and efficient.

And Then What?
--------------

The future of black marketeering and buying and selling products of which the State does not approve is 
by trading locally, person-to-person. Using clandestine tunnels and neighborhood adhoc wifi, you can 
make the jobs of State enforcers a very difficult and migrane-inducing endeavor.

These clandestine networks can be very affordable even for the underclass, and can carry a surprisingly 
large amount of information with some clever routing and clever caching schemes.

Without the Fox Engine, you can route using Batman and Babel, which has negligible overhead, using 
plug computers, fixed wireless and ordinary telephone wire. Even simple USB dialup modems can offer 
a surprisingly large amount of bandwidth, although I'd still advise using minimalistic protocols 
such as Usenet, Gopher and IRC.

For Usenet, I'd recommend using both TLS and PGP email and newsgroup post encryption. Often, simply signing 
newsgroup posts can offer a lot of privacy, especially if you are careful who you give your PGP public key 
to, and how you go about doing it. RetroShare can also offer a lot of this functionality.

As for routing, I recommend multi-layered Network Address Translation, possibly using an alternative IS-IS 
and BGP addressspace. The idea is to deliberately make it incompatible with the Internet, using chains 
of open HTTP CONNECT proxies (open only on the inside, not the outside, to help thwart 
anti-proxy filtering), to gateway out.

Optionally, VPN tunnels using quicktun (I recommend using libNACL cryptography), OpenVPN, Tinc 
or (if available) IPsec. These tunnels can help bridge across difficult areas, while maintaining some 
semblance of privacy and security.

Another option as an alternative to BGP and IS-IS routing (and a partial alternative to Batman and Babel) 
might be CJDNS, which is fast and efficient, and automated to a large extent, although it is 
bleeding edge software, and should not be relied on for anything really important.

To conclude, the Fox Engine provides a more cohesive, comprehensive, automated and integrated network 
stack intended to provide extremely bandwidth-conservative routing, content distribution and 
location-aware application-layer functions and services. Existing software can do this to some 
extent, but is not trivial to configure or use for individuals who are not seasoned system and 
network administration professionals.
